# Rhythm Dash!

In my project, the player uses a joystick to control a character that appears on the LCD screen. The objective of the game is to collect music notes, while avoiding the skulls (obstacles). There are two difficulty options that the player can pick; if the player chooses the easy difficulty, the starting health would be 3, and the amount of obstacles will be considerably less. However, if the player chooses the hard difficulty, then the starting health will only be 1 and the amount of obstacles will increase.
	If the player loses all their health, a “FAIL” screen will appear. The player can then choose to go back to the main menu (A4), or restart the game from the beginning (A3). The game automatically wins when the player collects 9 notes, and a “WIN” menu will appear.
